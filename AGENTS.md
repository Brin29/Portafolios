# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

Fixes should make the system simpler, not more complex. Prefer removing or consolidating code over adding a new layer, flag, or special case. If a fix grows the system's surface area, look for the version that shrinks it.

I'm building my front-end software developer portfolio using Next.js. The idea behind this portfolio is to have a very professional design with high-quality animations using GSP and a brutalist, modern aesthetic.

I want all text information to be retrieved from the “data” folder and its respective JSON files; no text will be hardcoded—each piece of data will be dynamically retrieved from the JSON.
